    "Description: A solution to Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 regarding the implementation of MyGaussianNB which implements Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in the scikit-learn framework. A notebook (MajorityClassClf) is provided with a simple example of a classifier that works with scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The code developed in this assignment will be extended in the second assignment to allow for missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "The notebook MajorityClassClf contains some basic code to help you get started. \n",
    "Provide a python class MyGaussianNB that implements Gaussian Naive Bayes. The conditional probabilities should be calculated as follows:\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathrm{P}(x_i | y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi (\\sigma_{y_i})^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x_i - \\mu_y)^2}{2(\\sigma_{y_i})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi (\\sigma_{y_i})^2}} \\text{exp}({-\\frac{(x_i - \\mu_y)^2}{2(\\sigma_{y_i})^2}})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where 𝜇y is the mean for variable i for class y and 𝜎y is the corresponding standard deviation. Thereafter the classification should use the NB formulae presented in the lectures. Alternatives that use addition of conditional probabilities or logs should not be used. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The API specification for sklearn classifiers is here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html \n",
    "You should implement the ‘fit’ and ‘predict’ methods, there is no need to implement ‘predict_proba’. \n",
    "Prior probabilities should be calculated from the training data. With this, there will be no need to pass parameters when instances are created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Test the performance of your implementation against the GaussianNB implementation in scikit-learn. You should use a range of datasets for this testing. Possible test sets used in lectures are penguins,  diabetes and glassV2. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "This is an individual (not group) project. Submission is through the Brightspace page. Your submission should comprise your notebook and the second dataset that you use. Clear all outputs in the notebook before saving for submission. You can use markdown cells in the notebook to report your findings and conclusions. \n",

    "## Solution - Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A function is created which creates models: SK Naive Bayes and My Naive Bayes.\n",
    "2. The My Naive Bayes function is defined. \n",
    "    1. Fit does validation and prepares the class stats for predict.\n",
    "    2. Predict validates it has been fitted. It goes through each row in the test data, and for each row for every class it goes through each column and gets the probability using the Gaussian NB PDF and then derives total row probability for that class. I do not normalise the probabilities across n-many classes as the only piece which matters is the max class. I add this to an array and return it. Validation is done against std.Dev=0 by setting it to the square root of the minimum float in this instance.\n",
    "3. Some functions are defined to create models (MyNaiveBayes and SKLearnBaye) and analyse them.\n",
    "4. Functions are designed to read in all datasets and test my implementation and the default implementation and validate they produce equal classification reports.\n",
    "5. We observe equality in the classification results we are obtaining over the non Missing Set.\n",

    "# Assignment 2 Specific\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to explore how missing values can be handled in supervised machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two strategies will be explored\n",
    "1. Consider missing values explicitly in the classification algorithm (Gaussian Naive Bayes) \n",
    "2. Use imputation methods to guess missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use the code from your submission for the first assignment as your starting point or you may use the sample solution for that assignment that will be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the Gaussian Naive Bayes code so that it handles missing values. Gaussian Naive Bayes can handle missing values in training by calculating conditional probabilities on the values that are present. You may choose to put a limit on the number of missing values allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should also handle missing values on any test data. The easiest way to do this is to leave features with missing values out of the posterior probability calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment on any design decisions you make in markup. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the performance of your implementation against the scikit-learn GaussianNB using missing value imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test two imputation options, one univariate and one multi-variate.  To help with your evaluation two versions of the penguins datasets with missing values are provided, one with 20% missing and the other with 40%. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should use cross validation for testing, taking care that any scaling and imputation is handled properly within cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment on the results of your evaluation. \n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution - Assignment 2 Specific - Design Decisions/Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I extend my assignment 1 solution to handle NANs. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. In the fit method, I alter the calculation of the class statistics by modifying methods to calculate based on the non-nan values by using the Numpy NANMean, NANStd, NANProd methods within the \\_\\_set_class_stats() method. I also change the check_x_Y function to include the force_all_finite=False parameter which allows it to contain inf, -inf, and nan values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. In the predict method, I alter the calculation of the row propbability to use nanprod * class percent. When calculating a probability, in the event that the entire row is nan, np.nanprod(array)=1, and hence the probability for that row becomes the overall class probability within the training set and hence defaults to the majority class. I believe this is a logical/suitable method in the absence of other information. I am highly highly reluctant to filter out data, with the logic being if a user passes a 100 row dataset with 10 NAN rows, the expected outcome in a production environment should be 100 y predictions, not 90 predictions with 10 NANs. While this biases predictions in instances where the training data is misrepresentative or is borderline in terms of weighting, situations which are more significantly skewed are better fit by this approach. In instances where only some of the data is missing, the row probability excludes these missing values from the calculation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Outside of the class, I adjust the test_datasets to include the missing value datasets - These produce a default error with default SKLearn implementation so I add a try and except for this case. I also alter the ingestion function to read ? as nan and to consider the first column as an index for the MV dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. For troubleshooting purposes I add a function to show some of the attributes of MyGaussianNB() and to return the models so that I can investigate and verify the probability calculations by performing some spot-checks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. I enable the ability to not use a scaler but keep the StandardScaler as the default.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. I validate that my changes have not altered the performance on the original dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. One note which might be interesting/useful to overcome scenarios where the bias towards the majority class is undesired would be to allow the user to implement either a probabilistic selection (in the scenario where all are nan, and the user passes 'e.g. binomial' as a parameter, the class selection is made according to that distribution, or alternatively to allow the user to supply weightings to the class percentage (this would essentially serve as the user supplying a Bayesian prior probability as it would capture what the user suspects the ultimate class probability should be within their dataset). As the results of the model were actually surprisingly good with minimal changes over the penguins dataset, I have elected not to include this.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    8. In the scenario where a user enters an entire column of nulls, I return an error - this should be dealt with in preprocessing and should not be allowed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. I implement the imputation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. I change the create_sk_naive_bayes method to take four possible imputation values, None, KNN, univariate, multivariate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. This parameter fit transforms the test set, and then uses that on the model generation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. I adjust the function test_on_single_dataset to run SKLearn's implementation with each of the imputers. All functions take the random state 14395076. I use cross validaiton with 10 folds.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. The report generation function is adjusted to combine the results of each of the runs (MyGNB, SKGNB_NoImpute, SKGNB_meanImpute, SKGNB_iterImpute,SKGNB_KNNImpute) to allow for an easy comparison. I add into the classification report the cross validation scores to have these consolidated in a single location, but they're also outputted during the runs.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Commentary on results: I'm quite surprised that the custom implementation developed is better than the SKLearn with imputation examples. Looking at the cross validation results and standard deviation of CV results, it looks like the differences may not be statistically significant outside of the KNN results with a p value of 0.05 (looking at the values, it looks like taking MyNB as a base and checking+- 2std around the 10-fold accuracy mean that all except KNN Iter would fall within this range) however I was expecting the results to be more balanced. I believe a signficant reason for these results is that as the Penguins dataset is imbalanced towards the majority class, my implementation works 'better' because there's a natural bias towards this class due to how I've implemented it which I believe is elevating the accuracy. Potentially if the dataset was more balanced between classes, we would see more of an equivalence with each approach (as we see Uni and Iter imputation are pretty similar in terms of performance; the KNN imputation is the weakest but this could potentially be fine-tuned with hyperparamter tuning to optimise the number of neighbours to take versus my approach which was to choose 5 neighbours arbitrarily and this clearly has not worked)."
